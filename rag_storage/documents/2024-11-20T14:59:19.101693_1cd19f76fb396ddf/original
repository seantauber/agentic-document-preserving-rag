Title: Climate Change Impact on Marine Ecosystems

Abstract:
This research paper examines the effects of climate change on marine ecosystems 
between 2010 and 2023. Our findings indicate significant changes in ocean 
temperature, pH levels, and marine biodiversity.

Key Findings:
1. Ocean temperatures have increased by an average of 0.5C in the studied regions
2. Coral reef systems show 15% decline in biodiversity
3. Marine species migration patterns have shifted northward by 2-3 degrees latitude
4. Ocean acidification has increased by 0.1 pH units

Conclusions:
The study demonstrates clear evidence of climate change impacts on marine 
ecosystems, with particularly concerning effects on coral reefs and marine species 
distribution. Immediate action is needed to mitigate these effects.
